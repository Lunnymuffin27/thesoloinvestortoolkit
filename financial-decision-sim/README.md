# Financial Decision Simulator (Project #4) 🎮💸

A game-like financial simulator where you **pick 2 cards per year**, face **random events**, and watch your choices compound over time.

This is built as a **static site** (perfect for GitHub Pages) with a **headless simulation engine** + a simple MVP UI.

---

## Features (MVP)

- ✅ Seeded runs (repeatable outcomes)
- ✅ Card hand each year (6–8 cards), choose **2**
- ✅ Random events (weighted by your situation)
- ✅ Stress + burnout mechanics
- ✅ Net worth timeline chart
- ✅ Year log (cards, event, system changes)
